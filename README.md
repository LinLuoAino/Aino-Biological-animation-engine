## 🧠 一句话介绍 / One-liner
中文：一个不算非常完美的耦合引擎：情绪 → 脊髓反射 → Huxley 肌肉纤维 → OpenGL 骨骼，3 ms 内让虚拟人「怕到发抖、累到喘气」。  
English: A coupling engine that is not perfect.: emotion → spinal reflex → Huxley muscle fibre → OpenGL skeleton, all in 3 ms to make avatars shiver with fear or pant with fatigue.

cd aino-pro && mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make -j$(nproc) && ./demo

## 请不要嘲笑我 / Please don't laugh at me.
Aino 制作最初是因为我的imgui的动画不够完美，事实上Aino相当一部分代码来自于AI因为我无法解决过于复杂的方程
Aino was created initially because the animations in my ImGui were not perfect. In fact, a large part of Aino's code was derived from AI because I was unable to solve overly complex equations.
